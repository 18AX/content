##### New: QRadar Advanced Searching
- The Playbook queries QRadar SIEM using complex queries in case the provided search values require several conditions. Complex queries take into consideration several inputs and allow to include or exclude each of the values as well as perform a full or partial search. Each of the values can be searched across several fields.
The playbook supports 3 full separate conditions to be evaluated

For example in the first inputs will evaluate several user names that may or may not exist in several fields. The second input can for example evaluate for IP addresses in several fields that may or may not exist in several fields and a third value can search for an event id that may or may not exist in several fields. The results of all of the inputs will create an AQL query that covers all of the inputs combining all of the different conditions.

Each of the inputs is validated so in case the inputs are not set correctly the user can review and run again.
Also notice that populated inputs will be combined, meaning by populating the first and second values the resulting AQL query will be a combination of all of them and not 3 separate searches. In addition to that make sure to populate the inputs in order both according to the indexed fields in QRadar (indexed fields should be provided before non indexed ones) and don't leave a blanc input, meaning if you have 1 inputs make sure its in the first input and if you have two inputs they need to be in the first and second input and not skip to the third. (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.0.0).
