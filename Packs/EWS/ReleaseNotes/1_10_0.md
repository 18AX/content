#### Mappers
##### EWS - Incoming Mapper
- Adding "Phishing Reporter Email Headers" field.
- **BREAKING FIX**: Disassociate "Email Headers" field since it is representing the original email headers and not the reporter headers.

#### Playbooks
##### New: Get Original Email - EWS v2
Unlike "Get Original Email - EWS" playbook, this playbook will extract the original "eml" file. It will allow a better extraction of the email's artifacts (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.1.0).

- Use this playbook to retrieve the original email in the thread (as eml file), when the reporting user forwarded the original email not as an attachment.
- You must have the necessary permissions in the EWS integration to execute global search: eDiscovery.
